## **Que 4: What is BIOS and system integrity checks?**
> BIOS (Basic I/O System) is firmware used to perform hardware initiallization during booting process and provides runtime services for operating systems.
> The main purpose of the BIOS is to perform system integrity checks, find the boot loader program and pass the control to that program. 
> BIOS is an OS independent, special piece if firmware which runs from ROM(Read Only Memory).

**System Integrity:**

An operating system is said to have system integrity when it is designed, implemented and maintained to protect itself against unauthorized access, and does so to the extent that security controls specified for that system cannot be compromised. 
A multilevel-secure trusted computing base ensures system integrity. 

**System Integrity checks:**
The system integrity check performed by BIOS is called POST(Power On Self Test). 
This is a very brief test on CPU, memory and storage devices to verify that the system is in a boot-able state.
