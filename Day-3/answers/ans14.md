# Que 14: What do repositories contain in a Linux system?

A Linux repository is a storage location from which your system retrieves and installs OS updates and applications. Each repository is a collection of software hosted on a remote server and intended to be used for installing and updating software packages on Linux systems. When you run commands such as `sudo apt update` or `sudo apt upgrade`, you may be pulling package information and package updates from a number of repositories. Repositories contain thousands of programs.

**Kinds of repositories**

* Main - Canonical-supported free and open-source software.
* Universe - Community-maintained free and open-source software.
* Restricted - Proprietary drivers for devices.
* Multiverse - Software restricted by copyright or legal issues.
