# Que 11: Difference between HTTP & HTTPS.

| HTTP | HTTPS |
| - | - |
| HTTP stands for Hypertext Transfer Protocol, and it is a protocol – or a prescribed order and syntax for presenting information – used for transferring data over a network. Most information that is sent over the Internet, including website content and API calls, uses the HTTP protocol.  | The S in HTTPS stands for "secure." HTTPS uses TLS (or SSL) to encrypt HTTP requests and responses |
| If a website uses HTTP instead of HTTPS, all requests and responses can be read by anyone who is monitoring the session. | an attacker would see a bunch of seemingly random characters.|

> HTTPS is HTTP with encryption. The only difference between the two protocols is that HTTPS uses TLS (SSL) to encrypt normal HTTP requests and responses. As a result, HTTPS is far more secure than HTTP.
