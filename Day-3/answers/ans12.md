# Que 12: What is SSL?

**SSL (Secure Sockets Layer)**, is an encryption-based Internet security protocol. It was first developed by Netscape in 1995 for the purpose of ensuring privacy, authentication, and data integrity in Internet communications. `SSL` is the predecessor to the modern `TLS` encryption used today.

**SSL certificates include:**

* The domain name that the certificate was issued for
* Which person, organization, or device it was issued to
* Which certificate authority issued it
* The certificate authority's digital signature
* Associated subdomains
* Issue date of the certificate
* Expiration date of the certificate
* The public key (the private key is kept secret)
