## Que : What are control groups?

Cgroups are, therefore, a facility built into the kernel that allow the administrator to set resource utilization limits on any process on the system. In general, cgroups control:
- The number of CPU shares per process.
- The limits on memory per process.
- Block Device I/O per process.
- Which network packets are identified as the same type so that another application can enforce network traffic rules.

**Cgroups have four main features closely related to each other that make them very important in a modern system**
1. Resource Limiting
2. Priotizing
3. Accounting 
4. Process control
