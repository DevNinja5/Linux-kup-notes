## Que : What are control groups?

Cgroups are, therefore, a facility built into the kernel that allow the administrator to set resource utilization limits on any process on the system. In general, cgroups control:
- The number of CPU shares per process.
- The limits on memory per process.
- Block Device I/O per process.
- Which network packets are identified as the same type so that another application can enforce network traffic rules.
