## Que: Unix timesharing 

This namespace is unfortunately named by today's standards. 
It dates back to the early days of Unix and has to do with how information was stored for a specific system call. 
Today, this detail is largely lost to history and what you really need to know is that the UTS namespace allows for the segregation of hostnames. 
Often hostnames are simply a convenience.
