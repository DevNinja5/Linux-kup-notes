## **Que :What are Linux Signals?**

A **signal** is an event generated by the UNIX and Linux systems in response to some condition. Upon receipt of a signal, a process may take action.

A **signal** is just like an interrupt; when it is generated at the user level, a call is made to the kernel of the OS, which then acts accordingly.

There are two types of signals:
* **Maskable:** signals which can be changed or ignored by the user. `e.g. Ctrl+C`.
* **Non-maskable:** signals which cannot be changed or ignored by the user. These typically occur when the user is signaled for non-recoverable hardware errors. `Ctrl+Z`
